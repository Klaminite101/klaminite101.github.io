my depression and anxiety is making me think that he doesnt love me anymore and that hes cheating on me but i know he loves me and hes not... i tried to explain that to him and i dont think he understood
so he may be mad at me
Hailey - 10/16/2017
It's sad when people don't understand your problems, especially people you love
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/16/2017
I'm acting like I just broke up with him... but he's just mad at me. I over react to things too easily
But that's not all why I'm upset
I'm really messed up
What? I had music playing
It's not just this... my mind is messed up
I'm like 99.999% sure I have depression and anxiety
He just makes it worse

Hailey - 10/18/2017
I was gonna meet with my ex today (what would've been our 6 month anniversary) to talk about things and try to work stuff out
He didn't show up
So we talked a bit
Turns out he didn't show cuz he was in the hospital for a suicide attempt
He attempted it after he promised me he'd be there today
after

Then he still told me he'd show up

Sadie - 10/18/2017

Kato - 10/18/2017

I guess this dream fits in the best in this channel.
Today I had a dream about a girl I haven't seen since 8th grade. Her name is anesthesia and she and I were never really friends. But it starts with us on the school bus, we talk for a while and eventually we get off the bus. I don't even think about it, but my legs just carry me off of the bus. We keep talking and walking. We stop and I turn to her, she has tears in her eyes and is somehow wearing a dress. She says, "My mother used to watch me play from that house over there." I thought for a few seconds and walked over to her and hugged her. She stopped crying shortly after and we kept walking towards her house, talking along the way. When we get to her house we say goodbye . I look over to see a group of kids and they knock on her door. I told them to walk away, they did except one. I didn't fight him on it but instead I was suddenly with my brother and mother. I asked if I could get a ride home and Zach said yes and my mom said she was going home on something called the "Drive Train" Suddenly I am there with Mrs. Gennaro and I'm completely exhausted so I walk over to table and put my head down, Mrs. Gennaro walks over and sits down a seat or two down from me and we are looking at this track, it has a like cart on it but there's only the bottom part of it, it's a model on the table. Eventually, a bunch of kids walk in, 21 or so of them. I count them and tell Mrs. Gennaro and then I wake up. 

I was happy throughout this dream. And it involved someone I had forgotten about and it was so vivid. It has to mean something.
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/23/2017
oh my lord i have to wait 6-7 hours for my boyfriend to wake up. i cant wait that long
Sophie| Panda - 10/23/2017
