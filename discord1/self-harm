frootloopstoucan - Today at 2:54 PM

I know this message is old but are y’all actually saying cutting gets better every time?
I don’t know much about cutting but can anyone explain this logic to me
Kota - Today at 3:32 PM
^ yes im also very confused how cutting helps. And dont say I wont understand because I used to cut alot. And it doesn't help.
Hailey - Today at 3:42 PM
When I cut I focus on the pain
I fell the pain on my arm and it helps me forget about my problems
I like forgetting about my problems therefore my brain associates cutting with being good and releases endorphins that make me feel even better
For the next few days I constantly think of the pain on my arm instead of what's happening to me emotionally
It's a really shitty solution but it works
Kota - Today at 4:03 PM
Okay but thats not helping
thats just ignoring the problem
that doesnt help it just prolongs the issue
Hailey - Today at 4:12 PM
It helps in the sense that it makes you feel better
For as long as you're doing it
Which is y it's a shitty solution
Kota - Today at 4:34 PM
but like... you're just kinda saying its okay to do this if it helps at  the moment
like that isnt emotional support for what they need thats giving them support for cutting
Hailey - Today at 4:41 PM
This group of channels is for talking about stuff
That's where the convo ended up so that's what happened
I would never ever support cutting
But I understand what it's like and why people do it
frootloopstoucan - Today at 5:22 PM
“I would never ever support cutting” yet you said “it’s a really shitty solution”(edited)
?
Hailey - Today at 5:52 PM
Whether I support it or not ik it works
It's a solution just not one that I'd ever advise or be okay with someone doing(edited)
Klaminite - Today at 5:59 PM
it doesn't work
Klaminite - Today at 6:00 PM
you're slowly killing yourself
how the hell does that work lol
Hailey - Today at 6:00 PM
It's how I explained
If u don't get it u probs won't no matter how I try to explain it
But that's a good thing
frootloopstoucan - Today at 6:03 PM
You’re promoting cutting
Basically
Hailey - Today at 6:03 PM
No
frootloopstoucan - Today at 6:03 PM
And I don’t think that’s a correct thing to do in a server full of depressed people, who are prone to cutting
But, I have never cut and idk if it’s good or not
So don’t mind me
Hailey - Today at 6:05 PM
I'm not promoting it I'm explaining it and there's a tw on these channels so anyone who reads this should be expecting potentially triggering material
Sadie - Today at 6:12 PM
Froot, she isnt promoting cutting
She is saying that it is a distraction and there r much better distractions than cutting and to not cut.
Hailey - Today at 6:24 PM
^^^
frootloopstoucan - Today at 6:50 PM
That’s what I got from the entire channel, but I guess I’m wrong
Kota - Today at 7:07 PM
I think you still have a point loops. As you said and I quote "It's sad to say,but once you get into it and realize how much it helps then it isn't scary anymore" in response to  sadie saying she is scared to cut.
Also you're not offering emotional support here you're just giving each other a place to say you've self harmed or post pictures of it. You arent giving any actual support or real help. Just saying its ok and shit
Hailey - Today at 7:21 PM
For me talking about my problems is the most helpful thing when it comes to dealing with them
This is a place for talking
Kota - Today at 7:27 PM
So its not emotional support its just talking
Sadie - Today at 7:31 PM
No
It is emotional support. Venting is a godamn form of emotional support
If u cant handle that then I will gladly kick you.(edited)
Cjhuber - Today at 7:35 PM
@Sadie is that really necessary to be said like that i dont see a reason to kick as its not like they are shaming they are asking questions to clearify and also there is a venting channel there is not a argument channel so i belive that in this case it can be discussed in this channel as there are no set guidlines to how broad the topic goes i can go either way and both sides have been presented
Hailey - Today at 7:36 PM
It's all good everyone
Just chill :smiley:
Sadie - Today at 7:36 PM
Fair point although this channel is labeled Self Harm
Hailey - Today at 7:36 PM
Imma go get a coffee brb
Cjhuber - Today at 7:37 PM
Okay and that can be taken as support and also in another way it is not clarified in the name is it?
Sadie - Today at 7:38 PM
Omg thats what I was saying
Godamnit
Kota - Today at 7:38 PM
I dont think you can handle that you need actual help and not just venting honey
you literally did not say that
tell me how you just said that
Sadie - Today at 7:38 PM
Venting is a type of support
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:38 PM
Okay okay
Kota - Today at 7:38 PM
okay but this channel is labeled self harm
Sadie - Today at 7:38 PM
This is for support
Kota - Today at 7:38 PM
not venting
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:38 PM
I understand that venting is a type of support
Sadie - Today at 7:38 PM
Of self harm
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:38 PM
And that the channel is for support
Kota - Today at 7:38 PM
there is a venting channel
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:39 PM
But how will a mentally unstable person help another mentally unstable person
I don’t understand
Kota - Today at 7:39 PM
^^^^^^^^
like you're just telling each other its okay when its not
You're getting help for the now and not for the long run
Sadie - Today at 7:40 PM
As someone with clinical depression Imma say this. She isnt saying its okay. There is a trigger warning on all of the Emotional Support channels
Kota - Today at 7:41 PM
As someone with manic depression. She isnt helping either
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:41 PM
“It’s a really shitty solution”
Kota - Today at 7:41 PM
a solution means an answer to a problem
Hailey - Today at 7:42 PM
Kota these channels are all for venting, #venting is for general stuff that doesn't fit into any of the other categories
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:42 PM
That’s irrational
Hailey - Today at 7:43 PM
Tell me how
Kota - Today at 7:43 PM
Either way hailey you ask people to join your emotional support discord but your not giving real support
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:43 PM
If you have a venting channel, why would you vent in anther one
Je ne comprends pas
Hailey - Today at 7:43 PM
Actually I said join my hangout server
Kota - Today at 7:43 PM
No you didnt lol you used to tell people to join ur emotional support discord
TatsumakiBOT - Today at 7:43 PM
:up:  |  Kota leveled up!

frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:43 PM
No no, you tell people to join your “emotional support server”
Kota - Today at 7:44 PM
well hipty doo
Hailey - Today at 7:44 PM
I used to
When that's all it was
ANYWAY we can all stop this now cuz it's getting us nowhere and is only upsetting people. We were fine here before, everyone was happy with these channels. If you don't like it you don't have to look at it
Kota - Today at 7:45 PM
You're not fine though.
Sadie - Today at 7:45 PM
/kick kota
MaxmindedBOT - Today at 7:45 PM
Usage: /kick <player>
Kota - Today at 7:45 PM
You're literally "supporting" each other cutting and doing self harm
okay bitch and
Sadie - Today at 7:45 PM
/kick Kota
MaxmindedBOT - Today at 7:45 PM
Usage: /kick <player>
Kota - Today at 7:46 PM
you mad cuz you dont wanna hear the truth
/kick Sadie
see i can do it too
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:46 PM
It’s not that I’m not happy, I actually couldn’t care less, but I think that you shouldn’t have this type of stuff even if you have a trigger warning, especially with mentally unstable people
Kota - Today at 7:46 PM
^^^
Maybe make a groupchat
Hailey - Today at 7:47 PM
Bruh what do u think a trigger warning means
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:47 PM
I don’t care
Kota - Today at 7:47 PM
Hailey your advertising your server on QC
Klaminite - Today at 7:47 PM
why are we using trigger warnings what
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:47 PM
Don’t you think anyone could come out of curiosity without knowing what TW means?
TatsumakiBOT - Today at 7:47 PM
:up:  |  Klaminite leveled up!

NEW MESSAGES
Kota - Today at 7:48 PM
@Hailey can you tell her to stop kicking me
Sadie - Today at 7:48 PM
I didnt do it the 2nd time
Hailey - Today at 7:48 PM
I kicked you
Kota - Today at 7:48 PM
but why
Sadie - Today at 7:48 PM
I did it once and Hailey did it once
Hailey - Today at 7:48 PM
Stop causing drama
Kota - Today at 7:48 PM
i literally said your advertising it on qc
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:49 PM
What drama
Hailey - Today at 7:49 PM
We were all fine before you came
frootloopstoucan - Today at 7:49 PM
He’s just stating shit
Kota - Today at 7:49 PM
can you let me finish my got damn sentence
also what loops said
like nothing i have said isnt facts like i havent been like FUCK YOU ATTENTION SEEKING WHORES
like no i didnt say that
Anyways.
You shouldn't be advertising people on QC or telling them to join when it has such triggering properties even if it has a trigger warning it shouldnt be public to everyone that joins as many people on QC are triggered by it.
I didnt even know that TW meant trigger warning
Maybe make a role that has access to these channels idk
Hailey - Today at 7:50 PM
I haven't advertised this on qc for over a week now
Because I realized I shouldnt
For the reasons u said
Kota - Today at 7:51 PM
I have seen it advertised the past week
Hailey - Today at 7:52 PM
Anyways this channel is here, it's staying, nothing about it is changing. I know for fact that this channel has helped me and multiple others to be more comfortable with themselves and how they feel, so despite what you think, it does help people. If you don't like it don't look at it, and if you don't like this server u don't have to be here.
Kota - Today at 7:52 PM
Also im not trying to start drama I'm trying to say what going on here isnt going to actually help. I dont see how that is drama. You are saying we were fine before you got here and we were happy. But sadie  literally said she was gonna kill herself and people are posting pics of cutting. That doesnt look fine and happy.
