Fuck testosterone
Luke - 10/12/2017
my bf has dysphoria
Hailey - 10/12/2017
It's literally the worst feeling ever
The feeling that u aren't who or what ur supposed to be
Luke - 10/12/2017
yea
there was moments he went quiet, and it was sad
Hailey - 10/12/2017
A lot of times dysphoria comes hand in hand with the feeling that nothing will ever get better
Which isn't very fun
Sophie| Panda - 10/12/2017
I hate taking showers/restrooms and changing...
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
when your own girlfriend says your birth name is your "real name"
fucking shoot me please
eggsloveme - 10/12/2017
not a good gf
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
she mostly is
she's very supportive of my name and pronouns and identity in general and all that jazz
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/12/2017
my boyfriend can just generaly be a dick lol
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
fight him
the alpha must be decided on
I'm voting for you
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/12/2017
hes the top, hes the alpha, hes the dom
because hes older and bigger than me
and has a dom attitude
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
you can still win
climb on him
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/12/2017
i dont wanna try

AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
I believe in you
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/12/2017

Hailey - 10/12/2017
I dumped my bf a weekish ago
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/12/2017
aww
im sowwy
Luke - 10/12/2017
@Hailey Where you bf's for long?(edited)
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Our 6 month would be Wednesday the 18th
If we were still together
Longest relationship I've ever been in
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
if he did anything shitty I'll kick his ass for you
JasperD|Wolfer - 10/12/2017
the one im in is 4 months strong yesterday
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
mine is going on 5 months
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Nah it's just he stopped texting me and he stopped calling me and he stopped trying to make plans to see me and we stopped hanging out and being together then he got into drugs and it was just a toxic relationship so I ended it
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
p u n c h
do I stay up late to get my homework done and end up looking tired as hell in my senior photos tomorrow afternoon during the photoshoot? or do I prioritize the pictures that cost $115?
Hailey - 10/12/2017
He was really sweet tho and I miss him but I'm not taking him back unless he shows me he's changed
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
punch until change occurs
the most likely change will be bruising
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Lol
I don't think he'll change tbh, which is hella unfortunate cuz he's a nice person
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
(just to be clear I am not actually a violent person I can't even kill insects)
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Same omg lol
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
I hate when nice people go down the wrong path
Hailey - 10/12/2017
O shit I made coffee I forgot brb gonna go get that
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
they have so much potential and they're so nice and then they start doing drugs and hanging with the wrong crowd and whatnot
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Tbh I did that too after I dumped him
But I realize how not good it is and I'm trying to change
I dropped smoking 3 days ago
It's so hard but ik I have to do it
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
the sooner you quit the easier it'll be probably
my parents smoke, I know how hard quitting is, but it can be done and I believe in you !!
Hailey - 10/12/2017
That's y I've been drinking 10+ cups of coffee per day - placeholder for the cigs I'm not smoking
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
I've heard that chewing gum helps
not the nicotine kind
just normal gum
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Depends on the person
I've tried all the tricks including nicotine gum and patches and none of it worked
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
my mom tried the patches and she ended up just smoking and using them which is even worse bc more nicotine
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Now I'm going on sheer willpower and determination alone
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017
remember that there's no such thing as "just one more cigarette", it'll lead to another, and another, and another, etc
no cheat days
Hailey - 10/12/2017
Ik that from experience
I've done the whole 'just one' thing multiple times
Seeing unfinished cigarette butts on the side of the road and not picking them up is the most difficult thing for me rn
That was how I got most of my nicotine
Let's take this to the new channel I made
AshtonTheShark - 10/12/2017

Sadie - 10/17/2017
Neat!
Sophie| Panda - 10/17/2017

JasperD|Wolfer - 10/17/2017
lucky
Sophie| Panda - 10/17/2017
he has boxers without his mom knowing
Everyone
I want to tell you guys something
Kitty - 10/17/2017
wot
Sadie - 10/17/2017
wat
Sophie| Panda - 10/17/2017
I don't see you guys as transgender honestly don't label you guys trans i label you guys guys and girls. and honestly I love you all so fucking much. You guys are like second family to me. Today I wanted to call my Gay teacher "Dad" because he's very friendly and nice. I feel very safe around him. He told everyone in my gsa meeting  this "If you have any problems come and talk to me anytime you want. this is your safe place." I felt very happy because some teachers don't understand him and my lesbian teacher from middle school do. because they understand us clearly in someway.
I hope this touches you all.
Sadie - 10/17/2017
It does lol
Kitty - 10/17/2017

Sophie| Panda - 10/17/2017

Kato - 10/18/2017
I told my ex (while I was still dating them) that I hated my chest. And they proceeded to touch my chest saying they liked my body the way it was. God I don’t care what you think of my body don’t go out of your way to touch the most dysphoric part of my body.
Sadie - 10/18/2017
She was a bitch
Kato - 10/18/2017
True.
Sophie| Panda - 10/18/2017
@Kato
If I was your partner I wouldn't do that. I would hug you say Okay, I got it.
Kato - 10/18/2017
that person didn’t respect me so it’s fine. Thank you, it means a lot.
They identify as trans now. But told me I didn’t respect them, when they didn’t even come out to me?
Sophie| Panda - 10/18/2017
they're fucking stupid
that's their fault. you didn't know. they didn't even fucking told you.
Kato - 10/18/2017
Exactly.
Their really dumb.
Sophie| Panda - 10/18/2017
are they ft, pr  mtf
ftm
or
Kato - 10/18/2017
ftm I think
I don’t really care though, since they still don’t respect me.
Sophie| Panda - 10/18/2017
yeh
you should respect their pronouns tho
Kato - 10/18/2017
I’m just using they because I wanna keep it discrete, they don’t respect mine.
